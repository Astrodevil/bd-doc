## Architecture Layers

Each layer in this system represents a modular component you can adopt independently or integrate into a full-stack AI system.

- **General AI Agent:** Real-time assistants (e.g., travel, logistics) with 99.99% uptime.
- **Data Enrichment Agent:** Automated table enrichment, validation, and normalization across any structured dataset with 95%+ success on protected sites.
- **Deep Research Agent:** Competitive intelligence and multi-source research with automated unblocking.
- **AI Answer Engine:** Low-latency, high-accuracy answer generation with validation and citations.

<Info>
  This architecture powers the world’s most resilient AI and data platforms,
  from research automation to RAG pipelines, analytics, and customer-facing
  assistants.

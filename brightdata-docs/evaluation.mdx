## Evaluation & Grounding Architecture

This reference pipeline normalizes raw inputs, enriches them across authoritative sources, aggregates and de-duplicates results, caches embeddings for fast retrieval, and exports verified outputs to downstream systems.

## The Difference

<CardGroup cols={2}>

  <Card title="SURFACE-LEVEL VALIDATION" icon="sparkles" href="/evaluation/">
      Limited access to authoritative sources and narrow coverage
      
      No historical verification or archived web context
      
      Single-source checks only, higher error rates
      
      Manual validation workflow, no automation
      
      Lacks enterprise-grade scale, monitoring, and compliance
      
      Degrades beyond ~1K concurrent validations
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Bright Data validation stack" icon="database" href="/evaluation/">
    Broad coverage across authoritative sources, real-time and historical
    
    Historical context via a 2PB+ archived web corpus
    
    Automated, multi-source cross-referencing with cited evidence
    
    Enterprise-grade accuracy, reliability, observability, and compliance
    
    Automated infrastructure with monitoring, alerting, and support

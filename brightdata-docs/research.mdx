## Best Practices for Production-Grade research

- **SERP API**: Use for search engine data (Google, Bing, etc.) with no proxy or CAPTCHA management required. Choose parsed JSON for structured results, or raw HTML/Markdown as needed.
- **Async Mode**: For high-volume or slow queries, enable async requests for 99.99% success and best throughput. Async is recommended for large research jobs and batch processing.
- **Pay for Success**: Only successful requests are billed. Parsing, proxy management, and unlocking are included in the price.
- **Troubleshooting**: For 429 errors, reduce concurrency or switch to async. Use engine-specific parameters for best results. See parsed JSON schema for advanced analytics.

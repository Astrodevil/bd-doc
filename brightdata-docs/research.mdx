Modern enterprises need research agents that can think, retrieve, and synthesize insights across thousands of sources — from the live web to historical archives — with speed, accuracy, and compliance.

## Overview

The **Deep Research Agent Architecture** powers enterprise-grade research assistants that can:

- Retrieve data across search engines, APIs, and internal repositories
- Merge historical and live information for deeper insights
- Operate under high concurrency while maintaining low-latency responses
- Ensure compliance and auditability across global data operations

## How it works

1. **Input Layer**  
   Accepts research queries via API, chat, or automation triggers.

2. **Retrieval Layer**  
   Performs hybrid search across Google/Bing, APIs, vector stores, and private datasets.

3. **Ranking & Filtering**  
   Combines keyword-based and embedding-based ranking for relevance and precision.

4. **Synthesis Layer**  
   LLM-based reasoning merges evidence from multiple sources into structured, traceable outputs.

5. **Delivery Layer**  
   Returns synthesized, source-linked responses through APIs, dashboards, or chat interfaces.


## Hybrid Retrieval & Synthesis

- **Multi-engine discovery:** Uses Google, Bing, vertical APIs, internal docs, and archived web data.
- **Ranking:** Hybrid ranking using ML evidence scoring and embedding-based similarity.
- **Latency:** Targets less than 3s p95 latency per query with parallelized lookups (less than 500ms source access).
- **Proof:** Benchmarked 98% domain coverage across Fortune 1000 websites.

## Standard vs Bright Data Research Stack

  <Card title="BASIC RESEARCH TOOLS" icon="sparkles" href="#">
    Surface-level data collection only, missing deep insights

    No access to historical or archived web data

    Blocked on complex interactive sites and login flows

    Limited to 1K concurrent source processing jobs

    Manual workflow orchestration and retry handling

    High failure rates on protected or dynamic sources

  </Card>
  
  <Card title="BRIGHT DATA POWERED RESEARCH STACK" icon="rocket" href="#">
    Deep, multi-source analysis combining real-time and historical data

    2PB+ historical archive for context-rich research

    Browser automation and unblocking for complex, dynamic sites

    20K+ concurrent extractions with 99.99% uptime

    Automated, multi-step research workflows with built-in retry logic

    Global proxy network ensuring access to any source, anywhere

    Enterprise-grade compliance, monitoring, and support

## Best Practices

- Use **hybrid SERP + vector search** for maximum coverage
- **Cache high-value retrievals** with expiry to reduce load
- Use **Chain-of-Thought LLMs** for multi-source synthesis
- For **search engine data**, use **SERP API** for structured or raw results
- Enable **async mode** for high-volume or slow queries (recommended for 99.99% success)
- **Pay for Success**: Only successful retrievals are billed; parsing and proxy management included
- On **429 errors**, reduce concurrency or switch to async mode
- Use **engine-specific parameters** for advanced analytics or domain-specific retrieval

## Example: Deep Research Agent

Used by business intelligence systems like Hebbia, Perplexity Pro, and AlphaSense-style research tools, this agent pattern enables:

1. Query understanding and topic breakdown via LLM planning
2. Hybrid search across live web, APIs, and historical archives
3. Automatic unblocking for protected or rate-limited domains
4. Multi-source synthesis with citation-linked insights
5. Enterprise-compliant delivery of summarized intelligence

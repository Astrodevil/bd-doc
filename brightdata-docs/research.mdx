Modern enterprises need research agents that can think, retrieve, and synthesize insights across thousands of sources from the live web to historical archives with speed, accuracy, and compliance.

## Overview

The **Deep Research Agent Architecture** powers enterprise-grade research assistants that can:

- Retrieve data across search engines, APIs, and internal repositories
- Merge historical and live information for deeper insights
- Operate under high concurrency while maintaining low-latency responses
- Ensure compliance and auditability across global data operations

## How it works

1. **Input Layer:** Accepts research queries via API, chat, or automation triggers.

2. **Orchestration Layer:** Breakdown into multiple parallel tasks and maintain contexts around long research sessions.

3. **Discovery Layer:** Finds and combine current news, articles and data from multiple sources or web archives.

4. **Extraction Layer:** To extract data from articles, pages and sources. It also handles complex operation on websites like form filling or page navigation.

5. **Analysis Layer:** Validates sources and findings from multiple sources and creates final coherent insight.

5. **Output Layer:** Returns final report with accurate details and source links in a structured manner.


## Standard vs Bright Data Research Stack

  <Card title="BASIC RESEARCH TOOLS" icon="sparkles" href="#">
    Surface-level data collection only, missing deep insights

    No access to historical or archived web data

    Blocked on complex interactive sites and login flows

    Limited to 1K concurrent source processing jobs

    Manual workflow orchestration and retry handling

    High failure rates on protected or dynamic sources

  <Card title="BRIGHT DATA POWERED RESEARCH STACK" icon="rocket" href="#">
    Deep, multi-source analysis combining real-time and historical data

    2PB+ historical archive for context-rich research

    Browser automation and unblocking for complex, dynamic sites

    20K+ concurrent extractions with 99.99% uptime

    Automated, multi-step research workflows with built-in retry logic

    Global proxy network ensuring access to any source, anywhere

## Best Practices

- Use **SERP API** for search engine data (Google, Bing, etc.) with automatic proxy and CAPTCHA handling, choose parsed JSON or raw HTML as needed.
- Enable **async mode** for high-throughput or slow research jobs to maximize success rates and speed.
- Benefit from **Pay for Success** pricing, only successful requests are billed, including parsing and proxy management.
- Troubleshoot by reducing concurrency or switching to async mode for [**429 errors**](https://brightdata.com/faqs/proxy-errors/429-error-how-to-avoid), check parsed JSON schema for advanced analytics.

## Example: Deep Research Agent

Used by business intelligence systems like Hebbia, Perplexity Pro, and AlphaSense-style research tools, this agent pattern enables:

1. Query understanding and topic breakdown via LLM planning
2. Hybrid search across live web, APIs, and historical archives
3. Automatic unblocking for protected or rate-limited domains
4. Multi-source synthesis with citation-linked insights
5. Enterprise-compliant delivery of summarized intelligent research report

- **Higher quality** through systematic multi-source validation
- **Comprehensive coverage** of public web + historical data
- **Always current** with real-time data access

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Input Layer: Research Query

**Purpose**: Accept complex, multi-faceted research questions

**Input Types:**

- Natural language queries ("Analyze AI startup funding trends Q4 2024")
- Structured research briefs (topics, timeframes, required sources)
- Continuous monitoring queries (track competitor pricing changes)

**Query Complexity Examples:**

**Simple Research**: "What is OpenAI's latest GPT model pricing?"

- Single fact lookup
- Current data only
- 1-3 sources needed
- Execution time: 5-15 seconds

**Medium Research**: "Compare AI model pricing across OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google over the past 6 months"

- Multi-source comparison
- Historical + current data
- 10-20 sources needed
- Execution time: 1-3 minutes

**Deep Research**: "Comprehensive analysis of enterprise AI agent market: key players, pricing strategies, technology stacks, funding rounds, customer testimonials, and growth trajectories (2023-2024)"

- Multi-dimensional analysis
- 50-200 sources needed
- Real-time + historical + structured data
- Cross-validation required
- Execution time: 5-30 minutes

### 2. Orchestration Layer: Workflow Management

**Purpose**: Break down complex research into manageable, parallelizable steps

**Research Controller** - Responsibilities:

- Decompose research into sub-queries
- Manage multi-step workflows
- Coordinate parallel investigations
- Handle dependencies between steps
- Adaptive planning (adjust based on findings)

**Example Multi-Step Flow:**

1. Identify key companies → 2. Extract company data → 3. Find news mentions → 4. Analyze sentiment → 5. Synthesize findings

**Session Manager** - Responsibilities:

- Maintain research context across hours/days
- Checkpoint intermediate results
- Resume from failures
- Track research progress
- Support iterative refinement

**Features:**

- Persistent storage (Redis/PostgreSQL)
- Progress tracking and ETA
- User can refine queries mid-research

### 3. Discovery Layer: Source Identification

**Purpose**: Find both current and historical sources relevant to research query

**SERP API** - Current Sources

Bright Data SERP API for real-time web search

**Capabilities:**

- 5K searches/second throughput
- Sub-second latency globally
- Parsed JSON output (no HTML parsing)
- Multi-engine support (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo)
- Advanced filters (date range, site, file type)

**Research Use Cases:**

- Find latest news articles and announcements
- Discover company websites and official sources
- Locate industry reports and whitepapers
- Identify expert opinions and reviews

**Example:**

```python
from brightdata import SerpAPI

serp = SerpAPI(api_key='your_key', format='parsed')

# Find recent AI startup funding news
results = await serp.search(
    query='AI startup funding',
    date_range='past_month',
    num_results=50
)

# Get structured results
for result in results['results']:
    print(f"{result['title']}: {result['url']}")
    print(f"Snippet: {result['snippet']}")
    print(f"Published: {result['date']}")
```

**Performance:**

- 99.9% uptime
- Average latency: 500-800ms
- No proxy management needed
- Pay only for successful queries

**Web Archive** - Historical Data

Bright Data Web Archive - World's largest historical web data repository

**Scale:**

- 2+ Petabytes of historical web data
- 15+ years of crawled data
- Billions of historical pages
- Daily updates and additions

**Research Use Cases:**

- Track pricing changes over time
- Analyze website evolution
- Find deleted or changed content
- Historical competitive analysis
- Trend identification over years

**Example:**

```python
from brightdata import WebArchive
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

archive = WebArchive(api_key='your_key')

# Get historical snapshots of competitor pricing page
snapshots = await archive.get_snapshots(
    url='competitor.com/pricing',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    end_date=datetime(2024, 11, 1),
    frequency='monthly'  # One snapshot per month
)

# Analyze pricing evolution
for snapshot in snapshots:
    print(f"Date: {snapshot.date}")
    print(f"Pricing: {snapshot.extract_pricing()}")
```

**Value Proposition:**

- See how competitors evolved over time
- Identify successful strategy changes
- Detect market trends before competitors
- Validate assumptions with historical data

<Tip>
  **Research Quality Tip**: Using both current (SERP) and historical (Archive)
  sources improves research depth by 3-5x and enables trend analysis impossible
  with current data alone.
</Tip>

### 4. Extraction Layer: Data Collection

**Purpose**: Extract content from both simple and complex sources at massive scale

**Web Unlocker API**

**Best for**: High-volume extraction from news, reports, and standard websites

**Capabilities:**

- 20K+ concurrent extractions for research workloads
- 95-99% success rate on most sites
- Automatic JavaScript rendering
- Handles anti-scraping protections
- Returns HTML, Markdown, or parsed JSON

**Research Use Cases:**

- News articles and blog posts
- Industry reports and whitepapers
- Company websites and press releases
- Public databases and directories

**Example:**

```python
from brightdata import WebUnlocker
import asyncio

unlocker = WebUnlocker(api_key='your_key', async_mode=True)

# Extract from 50 sources in parallel
async def extract_research_sources(urls):
    tasks = [unlocker.get(url, format='markdown') for url in urls]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)

    # Filter successful extractions
    extracted = []
    for url, result in zip(urls, results):
        if not isinstance(result, Exception):
            extracted.append({
                'url': url,
                'content': result.text,
                'title': result.title,
                'published_date': result.metadata.get('published_date')
            })

    return extracted

# Process 50 sources in ~5 seconds
data = await extract_research_sources(top_50_sources)
```

**Performance Metrics:**

- Average extraction time: 2-4 seconds
- Success rate: 95-99% depending on site
- Cost: $0.01-0.03 per successful request

**Agent Browser**

**Best for**: Complex interactions (forms, logins, navigation)

**Use Cases:**

- Data behind paywalls (with proper credentials)
- Multi-page reports requiring navigation

### 5. Analysis Layer: Data Processing

**Purpose**: Validate, cross-reference, and synthesize extracted data into insights

**Cross-Reference Engine** - Validation Through Multiple Sources

- Identify common facts across sources
- Detect contradictions and outliers
- Assign confidence scores
- Track source reliability over time

**Example**: If 7/10 sources say "funding: $50M" but 3/10 say "$45M", assign higher confidence to $50M

**LLM Synthesizer** - AI-Powered Analysis

- Summarize findings across sources
- Identify key trends and patterns
- Extract structured data from unstructured text
- Generate insights and recommendations

**Integration**: Works with GPT-4, Claude, Llama, or custom models

**Implementation Example:**

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any
from collections import Counter
import openai

class ResearchAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, openai_api_key: str):
        self.openai_client = openai.Client(api_key=openai_api_key)

    def cross_validate(self, extractions: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Cross-validate facts across multiple sources"""
        validated_facts = {}

        # Example: Validate funding amount
        funding_amounts = []
        for ext in extractions:
            if 'funding' in ext:
                funding_amounts.append(ext['funding'])

        if funding_amounts:
            # Find most common value
            funding_counter = Counter(funding_amounts)
            most_common_funding, count = funding_counter.most_common(1)[0]

            validated_facts['funding'] = {
                'value': most_common_funding,
                'confidence': count / len(funding_amounts),
                'sources': count,
                'total_sources': len(funding_amounts)
            }

        return validated_facts

    async def synthesize_report(self, validated_facts: Dict, query: str) -> str:
        """Use LLM to generate comprehensive research report"""

        # Prepare context from validated facts
        context = self.format_facts_for_llm(validated_facts)

        # Generate report with GPT-4
        response = await self.openai_client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4-turbo",
            messages=[
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": "You are a research analyst creating comprehensive reports from validated web data."
                },
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": f"Research Query: {query}\n\nValidated Facts:\n{context}\n\nCreate a comprehensive research report with:\n1. Executive Summary\n2. Key Findings\n3. Detailed Analysis\n4. Trends and Patterns\n5. Recommendations\n\nCite sources and include confidence levels."
                }
            ],
            temperature=0.3  # Lower temperature for factual analysis
        )

        return response.choices[0].message.content
```

<Info>
  **Quality Assurance**: Research platforms using cross-validation report 40-60%
  fewer factual errors compared to single-source systems. Confidence scoring
  helps users assess reliability.

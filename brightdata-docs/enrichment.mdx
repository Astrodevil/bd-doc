## Best Practices for Production-Grade Enrichment

- **Bright Data Web Unlocker**: Use for high-scale, non-interactive scraping. Pay only for successful requests. Automatically manages proxies, headers, fingerprinting, and CAPTCHAs.
- **Async mode for scale**: For large batches or high concurrency, enable async requests to maximize throughput and reliability. Recommended for 1K+ parallel jobs to avoid 429 errors.
- **Bright Data Browser API**: When interacting with dynamic sites (fill forms, click, scroll), use full browser automation at scale. Integrates with Puppeteer, Playwright, and Selenium.
- **Troubleshooting strategy**: If direct API endpoint scraping fails, target the main webpage. For complex cases, use the Browser API to observe and replay frontend API calls.

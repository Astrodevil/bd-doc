Modern platforms need AI agents that can think, act, and respond in real time, flight trackers, support assistants, or system monitors that stay online 24/7 and scale without downtime.

## Overview

The **General AI Agent Architecture** powers real-time assistants and workflow agents that can:

- Answer live data queries (flight status, price checks, logistics updates)
- Orchestrate multiple APIs, sites, and workflows safely
- Operate under high concurrency with enterprise-level uptime (99.99%)
- 99.3%+ success rate with automated CAPTCHA solving and unblocking

## How it works

<Info>
Example Implementation: Flight status: Travel booking platforms, airline chatbots, corporate travel management systems accessing live flight data
</Info>

1. **Input Layer:** Accepts user or system queries via REST API, chat interface, or automation triggers.

2. **AI Orchestration:** LLM or rules-driven planner interprets intent, builds an execution plan, and dynamically selects sources.

3. **Source & Workflow Runner:** Executes calls to primary, secondary, or tertiary data sources for redundancy.

4. **Data Access Layer:** Uses **[Web Unlocker](https://brightdata.com/products/web-unlocker)** for resilient data access (handles blocks, CAPTCHAs, rate limits automatically).  

5. **AI Analysis:** Synthesizes data, interprets it, and structures clean responses using LLMs.

6. **Output Layer:** Returns the final, structured output to the requesting app, chat, or API.

## Best Practices

- Use **[Browser API](https://brightdata.com/products/scraping-browser)** for robust automation and unblocking at scale.
- Use **Web Unlocker** for fast, non-interactive data extraction with automatic proxy and CAPTCHA handling.
- Enable **async mode** for high concurrency (scale beyond 1K jobs)
- Proactively switch between endpoints/browsing when encountering failures/blocks

## Example: Real-Time Flight Status Agent

A global travel platform uses this architecture to process flight queries like “AA1234”:

1. The agent detects the flight intent and identifies data sources (airline site, flight tracker, airport API).  
2. It queries multiple live endpoints in parallel to ensure redundancy.  
3. The **Web Unlocker** automatically solves CAPTCHAs and handles rate limits.  
4. The **AI Analysis Layer** aggregates the verified data.  
5. A clean, structured response is returned instantly to chat or app interfaces.

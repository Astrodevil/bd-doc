Modern platforms need AI agents that can think, act, and respond in real time, flight trackers, support assistants, or system monitors that stay online 24/7 and scale without downtime.

## Overview

The **General AI Agent Architecture** powers real-time assistants and workflow agents that can:

- Answer live data queries (price checks, logistics updates, service availability)
- Orchestrate multiple APIs, websites, and workflows safely and reliably
- Operate under high concurrency with enterprise-level uptime (99.99%)
- 99.3%+ success rate with automated [CAPTCHA solving](https://brightdata.com/products/web-unlocker/captcha-solver) and unblocking

## How it works

<Info>
  Example Implementation: Flight status: Travel booking platforms, airline
  chatbots, corporate travel management systems accessing live flight data
</Info>

1. **Input Layer:** Accepts user or system queries via REST API, chat interface, or automation triggers.

2. **AI Orchestration:** LLM or rules-driven planner interprets intent, builds an execution plan, dynamically selects sources and coordinates multi-agent workflows using AI agent frameworks like [**CrewAI**](https://docs.brightdata.com/integrations/crew-ai), [**Agno**](https://docs.brightdata.com/integrations/agno), [**LangChain**](https://docs.brightdata.com/integrations/langchain), [**Vercel AI SDK**](https://docs.brightdata.com/integrations/vercel-ai-sdk) and [more](https://docs.brightdata.com/integrations/ai-integrations).

3. **Source & Workflow Runner:** Executes calls to primary, secondary, or tertiary data sources for redundancy.

4. **Data Access Layer:** Uses **[Web Unlocker](https://docs.brightdata.com/scraping-automation/web-unlocker/introduction)** for resilient data access (handles blocks, CAPTCHAs, rate limits automatically).

5. **AI Analysis:** Synthesizes data, interprets it, and structures clean responses using LLMs.

6. **Output Layer:** Returns the final, structured output to the requesting app, chat interface, or API endpoint.

## Best Practices

- Use [**Browser API**](https://docs.brightdata.com/scraping-automation/scraping-browser/introduction) for robust automation and unblocking at scale, especially for complex workflows.
- Use [**Web Unlocker**](https://docs.brightdata.com/scraping-automation/web-unlocker/introduction) for fast, non-interactive data extraction with automatic [proxy](https://docs.brightdata.com/proxy-networks/introduction) and CAPTCHA handling.
- Enable **async mode** for high concurrency (scale beyond 1K jobs).
- Proactively switch between endpoints/browsing when encountering failures/blocks

## Standard vs Bright Data Infrastructure

  <Card title="STANDARD INFRASTRUCTURE" icon="sparkles" href="#">
    60% failure rate on airline websites due to anti-bot and rate limits

    CAPTCHA challenges stop agents completely

    Rate limiting blocks real-time scaling

    Frequent timeouts during peak travel or high concurrency

    No SLA or compliance for business-critical apps

  </Card>
  
  <Card title="BRIGHT DATA INFRASTRUCTURE" icon="rocket" href="#">
    99.3%+ success rate with automated CAPTCHA solving and unblocking

    Real-time flight data access at global scale

    1,000+ concurrent flight queries with 99.99% uptime

    Sub-second response times, even under peak load

    Global proxy network with automated management

## Example: Real-Time Flight Status Agent

A global travel platform uses this architecture to process flight queries like “AA1234”:

1. The agent detects the flight intent and identifies data sources (airline site, flight tracker, airport API).
2. It queries multiple live endpoints in parallel to ensure redundancy.
3. Automatic CAPTCHA solving and proxy rotation handles blocks and rate limits.
4. The **AI Analysis Layer** aggregates the verified data from all sources.
5. A clean, structured response is returned instantly to chat or app interfaces.
